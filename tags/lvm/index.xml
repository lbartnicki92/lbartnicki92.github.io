      <description>If you are searching for better manageability of storage layer under your docker images and container you should consider devicemapper storage driver.
It gives you ability to use block device instead of standard file based storage.
Configure devicemapper with lvm as storage driver  Important! If you creating fresh docker installation and want to use only one block device as storage - from docker 17.06 you can use autoconfigure feature, simply by adding to /etc/docker/daemon.</description>
