      <description>If you are searching for better manageability of storage layer under your docker images and container you should consider devicemapper storage driver.
It gives you ability to use block device instead of standard file based storage.
Configure devicemapper with lvm as storage driver  Important! If you creating fresh docker installation and want to use only one block device as storage - from docker 17.06 you can use autoconfigure feature, simply by adding to /etc/docker/daemon.</description>

      <description>Each container except read only image space, consume also some writable space from storage layer.
This writable and none writable space are managed together by storage driver.
What is storage driver? Storage driver is a plugin for docker which is responsible for creating and maintaining union filesystem used by containers - for example: creating proper directory layout on filesystem.
It is important to notice that under storage driver we always have got regular filesystem like ext4, zfs or vfs.</description>
